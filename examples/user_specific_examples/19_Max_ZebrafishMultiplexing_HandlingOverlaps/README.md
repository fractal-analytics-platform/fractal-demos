This example also contains a notebook that allows a user to look for unexpected overlaps between FOVs and save a corrected site_metadata table. This table can then be loaded into the Fractal task as seen in the `args_create_ome_zarr.json` file that gets generated by the `run_example.sh` script. Tables for the multiplexing data from Max are included with this example.

An executor with more memory than 1 GB (default at the moment for CPU-low) is required for the napari workflow task, then the example runs. Also, Max's example needs higher memory executors for the `Convert Yokogawa to OME-Zarr` task.

I have run it successfully up to & including the first cellpose task. The tasks afterwards are to be tested.

It ran in:   
* `fractal-server==1.0.0b3, fractal-client==1.0.0a2, fracal-tasks-core==0.6.2`

(with napari v0.4.16 and changes from here: https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-tasks-core/pull/258)
