This example also contains a notebook that allows a user to look for unexpected overlaps between FOVs and save a corrected site_metadata table. This table can then be loaded into the Fractal task as seen in the `args_create_ome_zarr.json` file that gets generated by the `run_example.sh` script. Tables for the multiplexing data from Max are included with this example.

An executor with more memory than 1 GB is required for the napari workflow task, then the example runs. Also, Max's example needs higher memory executors for the `Convert Yokogawa to OME-Zarr` task.
