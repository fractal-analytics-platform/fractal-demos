**IMPORTANT**: The `BASE_FOLDER_EXAMPLE` at the top of the script needs to point to the examples folder of the user you submit the example from.

The user needs to run `install_client.sh` (once to set up the client environment, available in folder 01) and `preliminary_setup.sh` (installs the tasks environment on the server-side and registers the user, also available in folder 01).
In this folder, `prepare_user.sh` needs to be run
